There are frequent interim assessments, a project, and a midterm and final exam. 

****

**Interim Written Assessments.**

These assessments are very much like quizzes. Five of them will be given during class sessions, and they'll typically be "identification" questions. You'll be given the name of a person or a concept, and you'll define it in a well-crafted paragraph. Each assessment is worth five points. The lowest grade will not be dropped, and there is no opportunity to make up a missed assessment.

****

**The Midterm Exam. **

The midterm exam will ask you to articulate or refine, in a practical way, the concepts of organizational management and behavior that you've developed over the first half of the semester. The Midterm is worth 25% of your overall grade.

****

**The Project.**

For the Project, you have a choice: you may either write a case study on a known organization such as Facebook, Apple, Google, or a "traditional" Fortune 500 organization in which you present the organization's current state, discuss its strengths and witnesses, and offer suggestions about the organization's likelihood of long-term effectiveness, 

OR

You may critically review a recent book on organizations and management. Your analysis should draw from the theories, explanations, and concepts that we have addressed in class. You will probably speak to such questions as, "What is the thesis of the book?" "What evidence is used and how convincing is the book?" "What are the implications for how we should practice good management?" "How does it hope to alter how we think and act as public managers?" "Would organizations function better if the author's arguments were adopted?" 

If you select either of the above options, your paper will be 10 pages long, 

OR

You may facilitate a class presentation, alone or in the context of a group of no more than three, on the topic of "Organizational Effectiveness" or "Leadership Development," scheduled for Session Eleven on November 6\. The expectations are high---the presentation would be given over one-half of a class session and incorporate interaction and reflection, not simply lecture. Media appropriate to the presentation should also be presented. We'll discuss this option further in class. 

Whichever Project option you select, the Project will be worth 25% of your grade.

****

**The Final Exam. **

The final exam will ask you to articulate or refine, in a practical way, the concept of organizational and leadership behavior that you've developed over the semester. As with all other assignments, the Final will be worth 25% of your grade. 

Sine stercore tauri.
