This paper will discuss the successfulness of teaching within the school systems.

It will discuss the five disciplines which are mental models, team learning, system thinking, personal mastery and shared visions.

There are many ways that the five disciplines can help students learn by using the staff, community, parents and the students themselves.

There will be different examples for each discipline that shows how the school board, principal, teachers, students, parents and community can affect how the student can learn.

Each of the
disciplines explains how they can make a school a learning organization if it
is incorporated and managed correctly.
